# Welcome to the components library for simplesthing 

This repository, a work in progress, is a demonstration of how an organization could manage frontend components using lerna, a mono repository, to gather the packages in one place. I will be using my personal website, simplesthing.com, as an example of how to build up a collection of components that can be easily developed outside of the main web application using Storybook JS.
